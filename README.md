## Introduction

Cursor is a powerful IDE designed for developers who need an efficient and flexible environment. By reverse engineering its gRPC interface, we aim to provide tools and libraries that enhance the development experience. This repository contains code, documentation, and examples to help you get started with Cursor gRPC.

## Features

- **Easy Integration**: Connect with Cursor using gRPC.
- **Extensible**: Build custom tools and features.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Clear instructions and examples to guide you.
- **Community Driven**: Contributions from developers around the world.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qozx/cursor-grpc.git
cd cursor-grpc
```

Next, install the necessary dependencies. You can use your preferred package manager. For example, with `npm`:

```bash
npm install
```

Ensure you have gRPC installed on your system. You can follow the official gRPC installation guide for your specific environment.

## Usage

Once installed, you can start using the Cursor gRPC features. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to connect to the Cursor IDE:

```javascript
const grpc = require('grpc');
const cursorProto = grpc.load('cursor.proto');

const client = new cursorProto.Cursor('localhost:50051', grpc.credentials.createInsecure());

client.getInfo({}, (error, response) => {
  if (!error) {
    console.log('Cursor Info:', response);
  } else {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
});
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to connect to the Cursor IDE and retrieve information using gRPC. For more detailed examples, please refer to the [documentation](#).
